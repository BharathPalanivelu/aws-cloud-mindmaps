# aws-cloud-mindmaps

#### What
This repo contains mindmaps that I have created about AWS based on public information.  Since all of the information is already in the public domain, feel free to use and share these mindmaps as you see fit.  

#### Why
This is how I learn.  Creating the mindmaps helps me learn, and helps me explain a topic to others.  I started using them with my customers and I got interrupted within a few min: "Will, can I please have that mindmap?".  After many of these encounters I realized I should make them available to others who might find them useful as well.

#### Software
I am using Xmind Desktop Pro V8 (now called Classic) to create these mindmaps.  These links below are read-only exports from Xmind Desktop Pro V8.  For those interested in downloading the free version, here is the [direct link:](https://www.xmind.net/xmind8-pro/)

#### Contributions
Several colleagues I work with help me review content, suggest improvements, point out errors, typos, etc. - thanks much to Anna, Alvaro, Dario, and many others for your help.

#### Known issues
So far the only issue I know about is with the export from Xmind in terms of capitalizing.  For example, instead of "AWS Security Hub", the export shows as "Aws Security Hub".  We have contacted Xmind and they logged this bug, and hope that will be fixed in a future release.

#### Contact information
If you have suggestions, fixes, improvements, or ideas to make these better or create new ones, please contact me at my work email: quilesw@amazon.com.

## Amazon Inspector
Amazon Inspector - An automated vulnerability management service that continually scans AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.

The original Inspector (prior to re:Invent) is now called Inspector Classic. The new Amazon Inspector, a completely rearchitected and redesigned version of Amazon Inspector Classic, is now available across AWS Regions. The new Amazon Inspector has expanded coverage to add support for container images residing in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) in addition to EC2 instances. The new Amazon Inspector offers multi-account support through integration with AWS Organizations, and continual software vulnerability and network reachability scanning based on common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). We encourage you to explore and use these and other new and improved features, and to benefit from the significantly enhanced security value.

## AWS CloudTrail (and intro to CloudTrail Lake)
AWS CloudTrail is an AWS service that helps you enable governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing of your AWS account. Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. Events include actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface, and AWS SDKs and APIs.

This mindmap also includes the recently released CloudTrail Lake.  Cloud Trail Lake is a managed data lake that lets organizations aggregate, immutably store, and query events recorded by CloudTrail for auditing, security investigation, and operational troubleshooting. This new platform simplifies CloudTrail analysis workflows by integrating collection, storage, preparation, and optimization for analysis and query in the same product. This removes the need to maintain separate data processing pipelines that span across teams and products to analyze CloudTrail events.
